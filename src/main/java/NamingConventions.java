    /*camelCase (pattern for naming variables)

    declare variable using method: first letter lower case and other letters first case

    The CamelCase naming convention helps make code more readable and easier to understand,
    making it easier for developers to distinguish between different identifiers and understand
    the meaning of variables and methods. Furthermore, it is a common practice in the programming industry,
    making code easier to share and collaborate between development team members.

    it is common to use CamelCase to name variables and methods, such as
    'fullName', 'bankBalance', 'calculateMedia', etc.
    In other programming languages, such as Python, it is common to use a similar style called snake_case,
    where words are separated by an underscore (_), such as 'full_name', 'bank_balance', 'calculate_average', etc.
